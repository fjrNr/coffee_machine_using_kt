# Coffee Machine project using Kotlin by Hyperskill

The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. Users can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money.
